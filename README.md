# or-gym
## Environments for OR and RL Research

This library contains environments consisting of operations research problems which adhere to the OpenAI Gym API. The purpose is to bring reinforcement learning to the operations research community via accessible simulation environments featuring classic problems that are solved both with reinforcement learning as well as traditional OR techniques.

## Installation

This library requires Python 3.7+ in order to function.

Installation is possible via `pip`:

`$ pip install or-gym`

Or, you can install directly from GitHub with:

```
git clone https://github.com/hubbs5/or-gym.git
cd or-gym
pip install -e .
```
## Quickstart Example and Benchmarking Example 

See the IPython notebook entitled `inv-management-quickstart.ipynb` in the `examples` folder for a quickstart example for training an agent in an OR-GYM environemnt, and for using the environment for benchmarking policies found by other algorithms. For the RL algorithm, Ray 1.0.0 is required.
