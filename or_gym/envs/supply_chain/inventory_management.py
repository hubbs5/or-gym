    """
    The supply chain environment is structured as follows:

    It is a multi-period multi-echelon production-inventory system for a single non-perishable product that is sold only
    in discrete quantities. Each stage in the supply chain consists of an inventory holding area and a production area.
    The exception are the first stage (retailer: only inventory area) and the last stage (raw material transformation
    plant: only production area, with unlimited raw material availability). The inventory holding area holds the inventory
    necessary to produce the material at that stage. One unit of inventory produces one unit of product at each stage.
    There are lead times between the transfer of material from one stage to the next. The outgoing material from stage i
    is the feed material for production at stage i-1. Stages are numbered in ascending order: Stages = {0, 1, ..., M}
    (i.e. m = 0 is the retailer). Production at each stage is bounded by the stage's production capacity and the available
    inventory.

    At the beginning of each time period, the following sequence of events occurs:

    0) Stages 0 through M-1 place replenishment orders to their respective suppliers. Replenishment orders are filled
        according to available production capacity and available inventory at the respective suppliers.
    1) Stages 0 through M-1 receive incoming inventory replenishment shipments that have made it down the product pipeline
        after the stage's respective lead time.
    2) Customer demand occurs at stage 0 (retailer). It is sampled from a specified discrete probability distribution.
    3) Demand is filled according to available inventory at stage 0.
    4) Option: one of the following occurs,
        a) Unfulfilled sales and replenishment orders are backlogged at a penalty.
            Note: Backlogged sales take priority in the following period.
        b) Unfulfilled sales and replenishment orders are lost with a goodwill loss penalty.
    5) Surpluss inventory is held at each stage at a holding cost.
