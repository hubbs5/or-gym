    The supply network environment is structured as follows:
    
    It is a multi-period multi-node production-inventory system for 
    a single non-perishable product that is sold in discrete quantities. 
    Two main types of nodes exist: 1) production nodes (which have an 
    inventory holding area and a manufacturing area), and 2) distribution
    nodes (which only have an inventory holding area). Retail nodes are
    considered distribution nodes. Other node types in the network include 
    1) raw material nodes (source nodes), which have unlimited supply
    of raw materials, and 2) market nodes (sink nodes), which generate an 
    uncertain demand on their respective retailers in each period. 

    Within production nodes, the inventory holding area holds the inventory 
    necessary to produce the respective intermediate material at that node. 
    Yield ratios are specified at each production stage relating the amount 
    of material produced from one unit of inventory. Production at each node
    is bounded by the nodes's production capacity and the available inventory.

    Lead times between neighbor nodes exist and are associated with the edges
    connecting them.
        
    At the beginning of each time period, the following sequence of events occurs:
    
    0) Each node places replenishment orders to their immediate suppliers. 
       Replenishment orders are filled according to available production capacity 
       and available inventory at the suppliers. There is a cost associated with
       each order request.
    1) Incoming inventory replenishment shipments that have made it down network
       pipeline (after the associated lead time) are received at each node.
    2) Market demands occur at the retail nodes. Demands are sampled from a 
       specified discrete probability distribution. Demands are filled according 
       to available inventory at the retailers.
    4) Option: one of the following occurs,
        a) Unfulfilled sales are backlogged at a penalty. 
            Note: Backlogged orders are added to the next period's market demand.
        b) Unfulfilled sales and replenishment orders are lost with a 
           goodwill-loss penalty. 
    5) Surpluss inventory is held at each stage at a holding cost. 
        Pipeline inventories also incur a cost for each period in the pipeline.

        Node specific parameters:

            - v = production yield in the range (0, 1].

        Edge specific parameters:
            - L = lead times in betwen adjacent nodes.
            - p = unit price to send material between adjacent nodes (purchase price/reorder cost)
            - b = unit backlog cost or good-wil loss for unfulfilled market demand between adjacent retailer and market.

            - demand_dist = demand distribution for (retailer, market) edge. Two options:
                - use scipy probability distribution: must be a lambda function calling the rvs method of the distribution
                    i.e. lambda: poisson.rvs(mu=20)
                - use a list of user specified demands for each period.
